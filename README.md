During January 2024. I was invited to take a code-programming test. As I hate code-programming test(s) since. I think they are just stupid. Also.
Makes no sense to make a coding test nowadays with AI technology we have such as chat GPT and others. Futhermore. Since coding tests does not 
measure creativity and also, some people is just not as fast.Why a test? To meet a human-resource manager , usually a person who does not 
care a damm about you as a person, to make sure "you are an acceptable human". What a crap. 

Here is the stupidity about tests for a job. "You are good or bad since you dont make a test" such a bullshit crap honestly. 
forest gump said you are stupid as you do. Hence HR managers with tests , they can classify themselves with this. 

So friends and sisters. Here are the questions and the solution. To fight against tests that make no sense. 

Here are the two problem(s) Statemens.
Notice. the solution is attached in the File with problem 1 and problem 2 accordingly.

Problem [1]
Functionality
The following fields are included in the form
• Contact Name
 is required
It should contain only letters and spaces.
It should be less than or equal to 20 characters in length
• Mobile Number
The field is required.
 It should contain only Numbers.
It should be equal to 10 characters in length.
• Email
The field is required.
It should start with a letter and can contain combinations of only letters, digits, and dots until it reaches the symbol @.
It can have 2 to 10 characters before the symbol @.
After the symbol @, it should contain 2 to 20 alphabetic characters before encountering the dot symbol (.).
After the (.) dot symbol, it should contain 2 to 10 alphabetic characters.
Eg: john.doe3@gmail.com is a valid email address.

• When the submit button is clicked, and all the validations pass,
• Hide the alert or error component if visible
• Reset the form data by clearing the inputs for the name, email, and mobile.
• Add the new contact to the table.
• The list of contacts in the table should be displayed in the order it is added.
Note: In order to show/hide the alert error box, use the display: none and display:
block attribute only. The test cases rely on this fact.

Problem [2]
Goal: Implement a simple accordion (expand and collapse) behavior for the given layout so users can learn about their book collection.
Technology: HTML, CSS and JS

Requirements:
• All items' titles should be visible at all times.
• The first item should be in the expanded state by default.
• When the item is in the expanded state, the collapse icon should be visible next to the title (rightmost corner).
• When the item is in the collapsed state, the expand icon should be visible next to the title (rightmost corner).
• Clicking on the title of the expanded item should collapse any expanded item and expand the selected item.
• Clicking on the title of the collapsed item should collapse the description of the item.
• If the "Multiple" checkbox is checked, it should be possible to expand more than one item.
• If "Multiple" is not checked, when a new item is expanded, the current item should collapse then the new item should expand."
